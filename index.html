		<div id="welkom">Welcome</div>
		<div id="panel">
		Have you ever wondered how life became from being an adventure to a day to day drudgery? How the rich get richer every year but the poor are scratching to get by, even in the so called First World? The answer is simple: Money is created as debt, the interest is never created, and so the debt increases and the interests gets paid upwards to the holders and lenders of money. Time to end this.<br><br>
		<a name=projects></a>Every kind of money system that has been tried has failed and has created countless misery. A fixed money supply not backed by gold is controlled by the issuer. A gold backed money system can be easily cornered. And a money-as-debt system backed by a central bank like we have today is an unescapable problem and enslaves the entire world. The solution? Work for free, for the good of your fellow man.<br><br>
		To take care of your fellow man really doesn't even fit the definition of work. But to feed the almost 8 billion people on this planet, to clothe them and to sustain their needs, we do need to come together. Let life be an adventure again by living for today and giving the earth a much needed rest. If we all leave yesterday behind, then what's to stop us from negating the collective debt and just starting anew? Only our own free will and human nature to make sure our fellow man is safe and taken care of is important. The rest is history, literally<br><br>
		Take a look at our Resources or scroll down to see how we're starting to get rid of money by "working" for free.

		<div id="producten">Projects</div>
			<div id="panel1">
		Our first project is starting websites for local entrepreneurs for free. To do this, we're making use of GitHub's static website hosting service (the same way the website you're looking at now is hosted) and a free domain from freenom.com to host and list the domain name in Google, making businesses easier to find and giving entrepreneurs almost the same features as some of the higher end WordPress blog hosted sites by also providing them with free maintenance. Portfolio's, testimonials, about pages, we do it all and provide a free custom built design for each and every one of them.<br><br>
		Other projects that we want to pursue is free clothing and food, but this will take a while because this will require cooperation from people who own land, grow cotton or food products and can connect us with tailors, distributors and build a network of recipients who need this help the most. If you like our initiative, please consider doing whatever you can to help us distribute, grow or produce things for free. There are no limits, as long as the entire process from end to end is provided free of charge and without input of money. This is not charity, it's an idea to live without money. Though this is complicated now, I'm sure we'll be able to make small steps and make our free products and services grow into a fully money independent operation.<br><br>

		Wherever you are in life, it's time to move on. We don't need to show you why this system is crooked because you already know it is. From birth, we're all exposed to darkness and it's taken as the way things are. Not anymore. To fully understand our current predicament, you have to look at the history of evil, and the role money has played as the main catalyst for it.
